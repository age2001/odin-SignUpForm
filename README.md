# odin-SignUpForm

# Mini project from The Odin Project curriculum to replicate a create account page.
# This project taught me about creating forms and using the HTML label and input tags.
# I also learned about using JavaScript to override a form submission to include extra logic,
# which in this case was to make sure that a password field and confirm password field had matching input.
