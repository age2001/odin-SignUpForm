# odin-SignUpForm

### Mini project from The Odin Project curriculum to replicate the following [account creation](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png) page/image.
### You can see my version [here](https://age2001.github.io/odin-SignUpForm/)

- This project taught me about creating forms, using the HTML label and input tags inside of forms, and linking buttons
correctly to forms for submissions.
- I also learned about using JavaScript and event listeners to override form submissions to include extra logic,
which in this case was to check whether the password and confirm password input fields had the same text.
  - This further allowed me to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript, as I had text show up if the password fields were not matching.

### Things that would make this better

- Although I set the type of input to expect for each input tag, it would be better if I used a regex pattern instead as
it would allow me to ask for a more specific input.
- Figuring out my own css styling and applying it to this page would be good practice for coming up with styles for future
pages.
